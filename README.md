# DM Optimization

## Installation
1. Clone the repo.
2. Create a sub-folder inside the main ScanImage folder.
3. Copy all files of the repo into that folder and add it to MATLAB's path.
4. The files inside `put_under_scanimage_folder` should go under the `+scanimage` folder.
5. Run ScanImage using `scanimage_dm.m` located inside the new subfolder.
6. A new GUI for monitoring the DM's operation should pop up. 
7. Load the `population.mat` file from `E:\Code\dm_optimization\population.mat`.
8. Load the configuration file `DMConfig.cfg` from that same folder. Two user functions should load.
9. Add the `Wrapper` folder into MATLAB's path. This folder is from Alpao, and usually located under the `Alpao/SDK/Samples/MATLAB` folder.
